CS50x Final Project: TRACKme

By: Dillon Fletcher

TRACKme is a website that allows users to create an account to track their location.

[Watch a video demonstration of TRACKme.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0b6C5qlwRw)

Users register for an account and once they login to their account, their current location will be displayed.
The user then has the option to track their current location.
When tracking, the user can give the location a nickname such as "my house."
The web app will now associate the latitude and longitude of "my house" for any future tracks at that same location.
So if you try to give a another nickname to "my house" or make a track without a nickname when tracking at the location assoicated
with "my house," the app will automatically update the track for you.
Users can see all of their saved places and can see a full history of the locations they have tracked.
Users will only see their tracks and will not be able to see other users tracking data.
